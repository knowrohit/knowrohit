## Hi, I'm Rohit  


I'm a machine learning engineer who is deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, building recommendation systems, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production. I write often about theoretical deep learning and applied MLOps.

🔭 pytorch and cars are the only things i love.

🥷🏻 i love building stealthy LLM assistants, will soon launch uncensored clean datasets on Hugging face

🚀 I’m looking to evangelize the Full Stack Deep Learning community.
