## Hi, I'm Rohit  


I'm a machine learning engineer who is deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, building recommendation systems, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production. I write often about theoretical deep learning and applied MLOps.

pytorch and cars are the only things i love.

i love building stealthy LLM assistants, here's my HF: https://huggingface.co/knowrohit07
