## Hi, I'm Rohit 🚀 👨🏽‍💻 🇺🇸 🇮🇳


I'm a machine learning engineer who is deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, building recommendation systems, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production. I write often about theoretical deep learning and applied MLOps and will soon launch a medium. 

🔭 I’m doing research at the intersection of deep learning and ChatBot development
🌱 I’m cracking the data science and machine learning engineering interviews.
👯 I’m looking to evangelize the Full Stack Deep Learning community.
🤔 I’m looking for like-minded machine learning enthusiasts to work with.
