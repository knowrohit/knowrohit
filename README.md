## Hi, I'm Rohit 👾 👨🏽‍💻 🇺🇸 🇮🇳


I'm a machine learning engineer who is deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, building recommendation systems, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production. I write often about theoretical deep learning and applied MLOps and will soon launch a medium blog. 

🔭 tensorflow and cars are the only things i love.

🥷🏻 Creating order out of chaos using binary cross-entropy loss function.

🚀 I’m looking to evangelize the Full Stack Deep Learning community.

🤔 I’m looking for like-minded machine learning enthusiasts to work with.
